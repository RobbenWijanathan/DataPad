**DataPad** is a lightweight, ASCII-based program written in **C** that provides two key functionalities:

## Features

### 1. StringFlip üîÑ  
A straightforward utility to **reverse strings**‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs flipping text forwards or backwards.  

### 2. Salvatore Property üè†  
A CSV-powered property management tool that allows users to:
- ‚úî **View** property data from a CSV file
- ‚úî **Export** data in a structured format
- ‚úî **Sort** properties by a chosen column
